## Rick & Morty app

This is a basic app that uses the GraphQL Rick and Morty API(https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

It is composed of a Home page with a simple carrousel, on the side bar there is an option to search characters by name, and where you can see the last three characters you've seen and navigate to their detailed page.

The detail page renders a picture of the character, name, gender, species, origin and a list of episodes.

I have used CSS Modules to add some basic styling and Jest for some unit tests.
